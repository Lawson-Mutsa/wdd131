            <h2>My Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>I created a website before I started Software Development at BYU Idaho. The website was developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend. On the backend, I used Spaceship as my web hosting platform and for domain registration. The link to the website is embedded in the image. <b>Click the image to go to the website</b></p>
